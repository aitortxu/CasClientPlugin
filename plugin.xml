  <title>This plugin provides client integration for JA-SIG CAS</title>
  <description>
	The plugin handles configurations of JA-SIG CAS client integration using 
	its Java client library versioned 2.1.1 with some added features. 
	Please note there is another Java client library which is heavily Spring 
	based; Although it seems a natual fit for Grails applications, it requires 
	more configuration works to get started.
	
	The client integration page of the library supported by this plugin is
	
	http://grails.org/CAS+Client+Plugin
	
	Please make sure necessary configurations are made in your Grails 
	application's Config.groovy file.
